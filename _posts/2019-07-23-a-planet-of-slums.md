# A planet of informality
As predicted by [Mike Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Davis_(scholar)) in his famous book _Planet of Slums_ in 2007 for the first time in the urban population has outnumbered the rural. [1][1]

In the process of the accelerated urbanization, today, around 55 percent of the world's population lives in an urban area or city, with that figure set to rise to 68 percent over the coming decades (According to the "[Population Division](https://population.un.org/wpp/)" report from the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs).



In this 55 percent, an estimated 25 percent of the world's urban population lives in informal settlements, with 213 million informal settlement residents added to the global population since 1990 (UN-Habitat, 2013b: 126â€“8).

And yet, due to the speed, scale, complexity, and singularity nature of informality, the discipline of design and planning still lacks the adequate knowledge and strategies to understand and address this global phenomenon adequately.
